# Tournament Prize Distribution Contract

## 🏆 Project Description
This smart contract manages the distribution of prize money for a tournament. The contract is deployed and managed by an organizer who deposits the total prize pool and distributes it among the top 3 winners.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a transparent and trustless system for prize distribution in competitive events, ensuring quick and verifiable payouts to winners.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Organizer-Controlled Deposit**: Only the organizer can deposit the total prize pool.
- **Secure Distribution**: Prizes can be distributed only once and only by the authorized organizer.
- **Support for Top 3 Winners**: Distributes prizes to the top 3 players with customizable reward ratios.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add time-based restrictions (e.g., distribution only after tournament end).
- Include a voting or DAO-based winner verification system.
- Support for more than 3 winners.
- Prize pool contributions from sponsors or crowdsourcing.
- Integration with front-end DApps for better user experience.
